# VS Code Tips and Tricks
Since starting code 201 at Code Fellows, I have discovered many time saving and useful tools for VS Code and the terminal.

## List of Tricks
### Split Screens
If you click the icon in the upper right corner of VS code that looks like a box divided in half vertically it will allow you to view 2 (or more files at the same time);

### Move Code Up or Down without copy/paste
To move a single line just place your cursor on the line to move and:
- MAC = Option + up/down arrow
- PC = Alt + up/down arrow

To move multiple lines highlight all of the lines to be moved and use the same keyboard shortcuts

### Autosave
To configure your autosave, click the gear in the lower left corner. Select "settings". Under Auto Save change the option to "afterDelay".

This will cause VS Code to auto save your work when you navigate away from VS Code to another window.

### Word Wrap
If you have long lines of code or text that are flowing out of view on the right of your file, you can toggle word wrap.
- MAC = Option + Z
- PC = ALT + Z

You can also permanently turn on word wrap in the settings (search for word wrap)
